## ⚡ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
*   [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
*   [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express or Developer edition)
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YousefAliMLS/CoreX-Fitness.git
cd CoreX-Fitness
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory and set up the database.

```bash
cd Project
```

1.  **Restore Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
2.  **Configure Database:**
    Open `appsettings.json` and update the `DefaultConnection` string with your local SQL Server credentials.
3.  **Apply Migrations:**
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
4.  **Run API:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    _The backend will start (usually on https://localhost:7xxx). Keep this terminal running._

### 3. Frontend Setup
Since the frontend is built with standard web technologies, no build step is required.

1.  Navigate to the `Front-end` Branch.
2.  **Option A (Simple):** Open the `Registeration Page.html` file directly in your browser.
3.  **Option B (Recommended):** Use a simple static server (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to serve the `Registeration Page.html` folder. This avoids common CORS issues when the browser tries to fetch data from the API.
